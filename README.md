# Raspberry-Pi-Xmas-Tree-Roundup
All the code for the Raspberry Pi Xmas Tree by Andrew Gale of pocketmoneytronics in one simple program

At the moment only basic tree.py and christmasTreeLight.py.

# Planned:
- One File only
- Start different modes with parameters behind the python file (e.g. XmasTree.py --twinkle, XmasTree.py --help)
- Include other (good) Code
- Hope for a new production of this great board / toy
